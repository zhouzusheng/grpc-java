# grpc-java An RPC library and framework

 gRPC-Java is an effective rpc framework, and works with JDK 7 or android. But when I apply the jdk11's module system, gRPC-java is failing with many problem. Then I make this project
to fix them.

## replace the build system to maven
I donot like gradle, so...

## upgrade jdk to java11 and its module system

It is the reason of this project.

## resolve any conflict
Due to oracle java, there are many problem.

## integrate consul
## integrate springboot
## make an example
